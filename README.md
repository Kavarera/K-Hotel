# K-Hotel (Beta)

K-Hotel is a business application designed for hotels. The app currently features four account types: Admin, Front Office, Housekeeping Supervisor, and Housekeeping. Each account type comes with distinct features. This app was inspired by the Lomba Kompetensi Siswa (Student Competitions) event. Two versions of the app will be available for both Windows and Android platforms.
